## Business Requirements

Develop an API on which to ask how often a certain product has been sold in the past days.

Every day the department will receive a file with the sales of the previous day. The file is a json dump, each line contains a transaction:

`{"Id": customer id, "products": list of product_ids associated with the transactions}`

(EXTRA) - add authorization

## Architecture and Technology Choices

```
File Storage                Local for demo
|
↓
Batch Processing            PySpark for distributed processing, Airflow to schedule, monitor 
|
↓
Data Store                  key-value, key = (product_id,date) => MongoDB
|
↓
API web server              Auth can re-use this Data Store
